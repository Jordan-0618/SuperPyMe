# SuperPyMe

Our Group aims to find the best locations for new chain restaurant franchises based on where the brands have the most positive twitter sentiments. We will do this using twitter scrapping programs in python, analyzing the information for positive/negative sentiment, and finally visualize the data in Tableu. 

After our initial visualization we will see if there are new areas that have similar demographics to the areas with positive sentiments, and see if there are oportunities in untapped markets for new franchises. This will be done using a machine learning program that takes city demographics as training data (using the twitter sentiment as the output)
